Topic modelling is a popular technique in natural language processing (NLP) that involves identifying the underlying topics or themes present in a corpus of text. One of the commonly used algorithms for topic modelling is the Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction (RAKE) algorithm. RAKE is a statistical method that identifies relevant keywords in text by analyzing the frequency and co-occurrence patterns of words.
