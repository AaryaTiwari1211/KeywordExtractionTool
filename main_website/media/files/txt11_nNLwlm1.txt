Add the relative form sizing classes to the .input-group itself and contents within will automatically resize—no need for repeating the form control size classes on each element.

Place any checkbox or radio option within an input group’s addon instead of text. We recommend adding .mt-0 to the .form-check-input when there’s no visible text next to the input.

While multiple <input>s are supported visually, validation styles are only available for input groups with a single <input>.
