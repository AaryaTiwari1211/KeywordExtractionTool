I'm writing a Django application which will require a Script object which has access both to a file containing the script and the fulltext of the script. The script file is an xls file, and I have no problems in extracting the data from it or writing data to it programmatically (xlrd and friends are great!), and I'm storing it in a models.FileField. I would like to store the fulltext in a models.TextField, but my problem is that I don't know how to put the workflow together correctly so that the fulltext and the stored file mirror each other.
